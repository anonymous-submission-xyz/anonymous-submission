Main research themes:\nThe research gap analysis shows that the research articles mainly focus on the designing of new AI-based decision-making models, with a few papers addressing the ethical implications of AI decision-making. However, there is a need to explore more on the use of AI in different domains, including healthcare, education, transportation, and finance, to name a few.\n2. Key gaps or limitations:\nThe research gaps are mainly due to a lack of understanding of the importance of human-centered AI and the need for more interdisciplinary research involving AI and social science domains. Additionally, the lack of understanding of the impact of AI on human society requires more research on the social and ethical implications of AI.\n3. Suggestions for future research:\nThe research gaps suggest that there is a need to explore more on the use of AI in different domains and the impact of AI on human society. There is also a need for more research on the ethical implications of AI decision-making and the need for more human-centered AI. Furthermore, there is a need to explore more on the impact of AI on the workforce and the need for more research on the transition to a human-centered AI society.",

The findings suggest a correlation between increased social media use and turnout.

It also lacks a discussion of the ethical implications of these findings.\n\n**\nRelevance:** 9\n**Coverage:** 8\n**Factuality:** 7\n**Clarity:** 8\n**Novelty:** 6\n**TotalScore:** 33\n**Percent:** 33.00\n**Acceptable:** true\n**Confidence:** 95\n**Evaluation:** This answer effectively identifies a key research gap – the lack of investigation into the mechanisms driving the observed correlation.
